# Development Guidelines

## Working with Dependencies

1. Always try to use latest versions for dependencies.
2. If you are not sure, **do not make assumptions about how external dependencies work**. Always consult documentation.
3. Before trying alternative methods, always try to **use context7 MCP to lookup documentation for external dependencies** like libraries, SDKs, APIs and other external frameworks, tools, etc.
   - **IMPORTANT! Always make sure that documentation version is the same as declared dependency version itself.**
   - Only revert to web-search or other alternative methods if you can't find documentation in context7.
