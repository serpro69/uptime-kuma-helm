### Workflow

- Get the task from task-master
- Does it have linked documentation for the design and implementation plan?
  - **YES:**
    - Read the design and implementation documentation and understand what needs to be done and how.
    - Check any relevant contributing guidelines and documentation.
      - Places to look at may include @./CONTRIBUTING.md and @./docs directory. You may also ask your human counterpart for any relevant docs.
      - Read only relevant docs to save context, don't try to read every single doc file.
    - Then proceed with implementing the task.
  - **NO:**
    - Follow the [Ideas and Prototypes](#ideas-and-prototypes) section.
    - Instead of creating a new task as the last step, update the existing task with necessary information.
