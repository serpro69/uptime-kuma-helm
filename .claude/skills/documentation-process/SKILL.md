# Documentation Process

## Guidelines

1. After completing a new feature, always see if you need to update the Architecture documentation at `/docs/contributing/ARCHITECTURE.md` and Test documentation in `/docs/contributing/TESTING.md` for other developers, so anyone could easily pick up the work and understand the project and the feature that was added.
2. If the code change included prior decision-making out of several alternatives, document an ADR at `/docs/adr` for any non-trivial/non-obvious decisions that should be preserved.
